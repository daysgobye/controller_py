# Gamepad Firmware - Configuration via JSON

This firmware allows you to configure a gamepad by providing a JSON file containing the pin configurations for buttons and joysticks. The firmware reads the JSON file and sets up the gamepad accordingly.

## Getting Started

To use this firmware, follow the steps below:

1. Clone or download the gamepad firmware repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies and libraries for your development board.
3. Connect the buttons and joysticks to the appropriate pins on the development board.
4. Create a JSON file with the pin configurations for the buttons and joysticks.
5. Flash the firmware onto the development board.
6. Start using the gamepad with the configured button and joystick mappings.

## JSON Configuration

The JSON file should have the following structure:

```json
{
  "pins": {
    "left_joy_x": "GPIO26",
    "left_joy_y": "GPIO27",
    "right_joy_x": "GPIO28",
    "right_joy_y": "GPIO29",
    "button_a": "GPIO0",
    "button_b": "GPIO1",
    "button_x": "GPIO2",
    "button_y": "GPIO3",
    "button_select": "GPIO4",
    "button_start": "GPIO5",
    "left_joy_button": "GPIO6",
    "right_joy_button": "GPIO7",
    "button_lb": "GPIO8",
    "button_rb": "GPIO9",
    "button_lt": "GPIO10",
    "button_rt": "GPIO11"
  }
}
```

- `left_joy_x`, `left_joy_y`, `right_joy_x`, and `right_joy_y` represent the pins for the joystick axes.
- `button_a`, `button_b`, `button_x`, `button_y`, `button_select`, `button_start`, `left_joy_button`, `right_joy_button`, `button_lb`, `button_rb`, `button_lt`, and `button_rt` represent the pins for the buttons.

Replace the `"GPIOXX"` values with the actual pin numbers or GPIO identifiers according to your development board.

## Flashing the Firmware

To flash the firmware onto the development board, follow the instructions provided in the repository's documentation. Ensure that you have the necessary tools and utilities set up for your development board.

## Testing and Troubleshooting

To test the configured gamepad, connect it to a computer or game console that recognizes USB gamepad input. Verify that the buttons and joysticks are functioning as expected.

If you encounter any issues or need assistance, refer to the documentation and troubleshooting section of the repository for troubleshooting tips and common problems.
